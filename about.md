Hi there, I'm Victor Pontis and this is my blog.

I'm an MIT 2015 studying Computer Science and Physics. Right now I am taking the fall semester off of my senior year to work at <a href="//picnichealth.com" target="_blank">PicnicHealth</a>.

I just set this up, so there should be more information here coming soon.

I took this theme from [Mediator by Dirk Fabisch](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator).
