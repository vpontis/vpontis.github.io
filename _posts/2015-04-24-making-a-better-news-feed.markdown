Facebook is distracting. My Facebook news feed gives me update after update of people I kind-of sort-of know. My ex-girlfriend went to a club with her friends last week. A kid I tangentially know from high school with just got into a prestigious grad school. That girl I met while studying abroad is oversharing about her last breakup. It’s not that I don’t care about these people, maybe I do. It’s that getting sucked into these stories takes a lot of time and watching other peoples lives prevents me from living my own.

Facebook is not a service that I can easily avoid. I use it for messaging friends, keeping up with events, and storing photos. But I do not want to get sucked into news feed and end up looking at spring break photos of a group of friends that I don’t even know every time I log into Facebook.

To resolve this problem, I made a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-news-feed/ckkppjogapagpeimgiadengmdphhline) that removes your news feed and replaces it with a nice nature photo and an inspirational quote. The picture and quote change every day to prevent you from refreshing the page just to see more quotes.

After installing this extension, my productivity has gone way up. I am now able to log in to Facebook, get what I need to done and then continue on with my life. In the past I would open Facebook, see something that distracted me for twenty minutes, and leave without accomplishing what I originally opened Facebook for.

I got this idea from Neal Wu’s Chrome extension [KillNewsFeed](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kill-news-feed/hjobfcedfgohjkaieocljfcppjbkglfd?hl=en) which replaces your photo with the quote “Don’t get distracted by Facebook.” I didn’t like being admonished so I decided to clean it up.

Here is a screenshot of the extension, [Better News Feed](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-news-feed/ckkppjogapagpeimgiadengmdphhline):
